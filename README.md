Bullseye NG
===========

Bullseye NG is a [Foundry VTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) add-on module assisting
the GM in keeping an overview over which tokens have been targetted by each
player. It does that by offering an UI element that displays all players and
their targetted tokens in a list.

Bullseye NG is based on version 1.0.3 of the original Bullseye module by
Victor Ling and is released under the terms of the [MIT
License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html) (aka "Expat License").

[Bullseye NG itself can be found on GitHub here.](https://github.com/DrMcCoy/bullseye-ng)


How to use Bullseye NG
----------------------

After installing and enabling the Bullseye NG module in your Foundry VTT
installation, the GM can show the Bullseye NG UI element by clicking on the new
button in the tools menu, under the tokens submenu.

This will create a free-float UI element that can be positioned at will. It will
always show a full list of all players and any tokens the player has targetted.
Clicking on a targetted token in the list will select this token within the
scene.

The Bullseye NG UI element can be closed and reopened as needed.

anvil logo has been removed.
