Changes in Bullseye NG version 1.0.0
====================================

This is the first official release of Bullseye NG.

Bullseye NG is based on version 1.0.3 of the original Bullseye module by
Victor Ling, mostly unchanged. It has been tested on the latest stable Foundry
VTT release, 0.8.9, and so the module.json has been updated to reflect that.

Likewise, since the original module has vanished and is not supported anymore,
support has been taken over by Sven "DrMcCoy" Hesse. The relevant fields in
the module.json and copyright notices, as well as all URLs, have been updated.

Otherwise, the only change not related to maintenance, is the addition of a
German localization.
