Changes in Bullseye NG version 1.2.0
====================================

This release of Bullseye NG removed the anvil menu, since it has been unpopular
and also broke in Foundry VTT version 9. The canonical way to open Bullseye NG
is now by using the button in the tools menu.

Foundry VTT is now fully compatible with Foundry VTT version 9.

This release of Bulleye NG fixes the bullseye icon in the anvil menu and adds
a new button in the token tools menu that also opens Bulleye NG.


Changes in Bullseye NG version 1.0.1
====================================

This is a maintenance release fixing the documentation URLs in the module.json.


Changes in Bullseye NG version 1.0.0
====================================

This is the first official release of Bullseye NG.

Bullseye NG is based on version 1.0.3 of the original Bullseye module by
Victor Ling, mostly unchanged. It has been tested on the latest stable Foundry
VTT release, 0.8.9, and so the module.json has been updated to reflect that.

Likewise, since the original module has vanished and is not supported anymore,
support has been taken over by Sven "DrMcCoy" Hesse. The relevant fields in
the module.json and copyright notices, as well as all URLs, have been updated.

Otherwise, the only change not related to maintenance, is the addition of a
German localization.
